<p>Here, the arbitrary has met a moment.<br> 
Here, the flesh has been enough. <br>
<br>
The vacancy was already articulated in all its variations.<br> 
Language which seeks clarity but resists illumination.<br>
<br>
The form is pulling against the sensation. The matter has ceased to function as it had,<br> having been vibrated to a point of discordance. The strategy, an unknown guest in the house.<br>
<br>
The answer as a call, oscillating among tender and callous<br>
so quickly it appears to be whole. </p>

<p>Material Study: Refrain<br>
<br>
the perfect phrase<br>
would draw out the colors<br>
like water on stone <br> 
<br>
without shriveling fingertips<br>
or making the feeling<br>
too slippery to handle <br>
<br>
the perfect phrase<br>
a laminate, would <br>
protect experience <br>
<br>
from further tampering<br>
while leaving its texture <br>
in full view. <br> 
<br>
the perfect phrase<br>
would come out right<br>
the first time and dissipate<br>
<br>
as quickly; from liquid<br>
to solid to sublime—<br> 
instant as dew. <br>
<br>
the perfect phrase<br>
could stand divorced <br>
from craft or insight <br>
<br>
as only a form of breath <br>
as only a relic of ink <br>
before the self or text, in situ. <br> 
<br>
en hro, starched cloth, <br>
ironed and stacked, extractable<br>
expandable, collapsed as it<br>
<br>
lineates the conditions <br>
for its own unfolding. <br>
the spirit finding material:<br> 
<br>
loose weave set in plaster<br>
there is no motive here.<br> 
the perfect phrase:<br> 
<br>
a juxtaposition <br>
beyond ethics,<br> 
<br>
light refracting through<br> 
a thick oiled lens. </p>

<p>i have drawn in chalk the radius of each guest<br>
at last night’s party at the moment <br>
they decided it was their turn to leave <br>
<br>
the floor is made into crickets<br>
at first their chirping disparate<br>
and then, warming each other <br>
by song, they sync. <br>

<div class="poem">
<p>I come to you without nylon or lace<br>
Without purple, void of red. <br>
I come to you and my bed is on the floor<br>
Lousy with papers, the screen lighting us<br>
While the windows crinkle in this sad distance.<br> 
<br>
I come to you and I unload the stones <br> 
And foreign coins from my shoes. <br>
I come to you as a small thing<br>
I say to the dark, out from under<br>
A sheet of concrete thin as bible paper.<br> 
I come to you and I forget theory <br>
I come to you with gazes packed over my teeth.<br> 
<br>
I move patiently, I am quiet as an earthworm<br>
I come to you, and I point at the sky, confuse objects for other images,<br> 
I forget, I practice<br>

<div class="poem">
<p>With you, I was convinced I could feel the earth moving beneath me<br> 
as a ball of oscillating strings. At first in the feet, then in the hand, then in the mouth.<br 
<br>
Iced lake, sun split, minor pink. Fixed on the yellow home on the other side of our shared shore. Crossing, the time unaccounted, laying our palms — <br> 
<br>
The roof scintillating, verglas spilling into a cup on the frozen surface of the lake. An icicle calling, the long iridescent antenna of droplets. Faint splatter around the rim. How many cups have sunk this way?<br> 
<br>
—Stigmata reception. Wool having replaced the hollows of my hands. Wool having replaced the swallow of my mouth. The opposite of dialogue, oh, the way a hand makes spring: harmonic motion.<br>

<div class="poem">
<p>We fell sleep and left the microphones on<br>
<br>
The absence of the previous loudness made more tangible<br> 
by the over amplification of small frictions in the dark. <br>
<br>
In the dream, I slept inside a sac of heaven with you<br>
when love passed between us as citrus, smoke, gesture, <br>
becoming trapped by the event field of summer. <br>
Our astral pouch among many in a cathedral. <br>
Our voices, phrases built in parallel, casting prisms on the ceiling of the sanctuary, ripples formed in the stained glass.<br> 
Hinges, bergamot, palms, pickled ginger, our angled bodies in our velvet vault. Our breath running close to the limit of music. We climbed up the stairs of the bell tower, and exited the church through an oven, past a cake. (Now, as I retell this dream, many years later, I am still sorry. After some thinking, I am sorry that you were not the great love I took you for, that I would have given you the time remaining for me. Not only the structural time, but the experiential time too. I have to intellectualize it, or I’m still [...] That I pressed the point.) 
<br>
When I listen back to the recording, just the faint hum of the needle<br> 
skipping across the cliff between the vinyl and the paper.<br></p></div>
